## MMA
**MMA将使用onenote和Obsidian配合记笔记, Ob负责记录基础语法和算法, onenote负责记录设置/排版/函数基础**
#### Basic rules of Wolfram Language:

1.  Wolfram Language commands begin with capital letters
2.  Function arguments are encloses by square brackets: []
3.  Lists, which are also used to store domains and ranges , are enclosed by curly braces: {}

#### Name of embedded functions:

If a command name is comprised of multiple words, like ListPlot , the the first letter of each word is capitalized.

Since all Wolfram Language function are capitailized , a good practice to use when definning my own functions is to start the fuction names with lowercase latters.

#### Style:

1.  If the function is recognized, it will be displayed in black and bold.

If not, it will be displayed in blue

1.  If function arguments are wrong , some red tabs will occurred.

#### Variables:

Be careful ! Once a symbol or function is defined , it is stored not just for this document, but for the entire Mathematica session. So it's a good pratice to Clear variable definitions

#### Workflow:   

#### Units framework:

1.  Inline free-form input "ctrl + = " ( internet connect is needed)
2.  **Quantity**[value, "units"]// units are given in their plural forms.
3.  **UnitConvert**[Quantity[2 , " Feet" ] , " Meters" ]

#### Defining Functions:

1.  **Delayed assignments**(延迟赋值)

:=

With delayed assignment , a pattern is defined on the left-hand side , and values that match the pattern are substituted into the right-hand side , but only at the time that the variables are passed to the function in question.

1.  **Defined function:**

Form: **f** [ x_ ] := x2

-   The underscore character _ represents a pattern and allow MMA to match any expression that is given as x. Besides , x stands for any expression , other tyres of arguments can be passed to fas well.
-   No need to specify a type for this argument.
-   Once a funxtion is defined , it can be used with the same syntax as any built-in MMA function.

Other form: **h**[a_,b_] := ab

Clear is used to removed all variable and function definitions.

**Clear**[x, a, b, f , h]

1.  One line correspond one output, but input itself can have many lines until you press " shift + entre" , so one input cells may correspond many output lines.

2.   If you don't want a compound expressions have many outputs, you can just type all the compound input in just one line, using the semicolon " ; ".

3.   The semicolon can be used to suppress output even when a singler expression is given.![[Pasted image 20220208094621.png|150]]
